# Task-Manager--Java-
The To-Do List app helps users organize and track their tasks. Users can add tasks with descriptions, priorities, and due dates, mark them complete, remove them, sort, and filter by priority. Tasks can be saved to or loaded from a file. A progress tracker shows completion, and notifications alert users of tasks due soon.
